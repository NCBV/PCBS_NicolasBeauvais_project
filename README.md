# PCBS Nicolas Beauvais project

I am doing my PCBS project on coding and Implicit Association task, which aim is to determine the speed of two-by-two association between items of two categories. 

The two categories will consists in words: first category is word-types => it opposes words related to Covid-19 (Coronavirus, Flue, Shortness of breath) to words related to random other things (Sun, Ice, Window)
The second category relates to risk => it will oppose words related to Harm (Harmful, Danger, Risky) to words related to Safety (Harmless, Peaceful, Safe).
